# Laravel 10 Playground

This repository serves as a platform for me to dive deep into Laravel 10, experimenting with various elements such as CRUD operations, authentication mechanisms, and other unique features that Laravel brings to the table.

The project is essentially a re-creation of my existing portfolio API, which was initially built using Node.js. I aim to use this repository as a playground to not just mirror the former API, but also to enhance and experiment with features just as an external storage on Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

As of now, I've achieved substantial progress on developing projects related to CRUD and authentication. The next big hurdle remains integrating with GCS which is currently a work in progress.

In the near future, I plan to explore and possibly integrate tRPC instead of the commonly used JSON API, and venture into other exciting areas, with the likes of gRPC in Golang being on my radar.

## Getting Started
To start the project, make sure Docker is installed on your system, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
